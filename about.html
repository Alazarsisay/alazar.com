            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Hello, my name is Alazar Sisay. I am a third-year Computer Science 
                student with a passion for Softer Development. After taking online courses
                 in backend development, I have transitioned into this exciting field.
                  I graduated with a degree in Graphic Design from Dire Dawa University 
                  and have since honed my skills in backend development, focusing on Python programming 
                  and database management.</p>
            <p>I have worked at Sarom Design Agency and Ebc Studios, 
                where I gained valuable experience creating compelling visual identities and
                 engaging designs. My journey into backend development has been fulfilling, 
                 with a focus on Python for server-side programming. Additionally, 
                 I have proficiency in working with databases such as MongoDB and 
                 MySQL, designing and maintaining database schemas for efficient data storage
                  and retrieval in various applications.</p>
